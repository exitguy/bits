# LEGO "CRT" screen

This screen has been build around a Waveshare 3.5" display that Waveshare was kind enough to provide to me.


## Files in this directory:
**LEGO_CRT.pdf** The exported PDF instructions. Should be all you need to build this model.
  **LEGO_CRT.io** This is the BrickLink Stud.io project file
  **Waveshare 3_5 inch LCD panel.dat** A 3D model of the screen for use in Bricklink Stud.io
